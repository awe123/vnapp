VNapp
==============



READ THIS FIRST
---------------

This application can not be launched without a running application Videnet 8
in a configuration mode. The app requires Videonet running over the top of the desktop.
It is possible to launch an app for a viewing purpose without Videonet installed. 
A file [example1.png](graphics/example1.png) should be opened in full screen mode and 
resized to the scale of 1920*1080. If it is a native resolution of a display, so leaving 
it in full screen is enough. An IDE like PyCharm or any other should not overlap top 
left quarter of the screen with an image that represents a copy of Videonet interface.
So, the application will launch successfully.


About VNapp
--------------------

This application is designed to help users of Videonet to see which servers are down and it 
has a number of helpful utilities like launching cmd shell or setting a time when the app 
is going to quit. The app doesn't load the system much. A time interval for scanning a screen 
and a main window refresh rate are ajustable as many other options. A file with settings 
has JSON format.
