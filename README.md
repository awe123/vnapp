VNapp
==============

A tool for Videonet 8 admins.

READ THIS FIRST
---------------

This application can not be launched without running application Videnet version 8 
in a configuration mode. The app requires normal fullscreen and not overlapped screen of Videonet.
It is possible to launch an app for viewing purposes without Videonet installed. 
A file [example1.png](graphics/example1.png) has to be opened in full screen mode and 
resized to the scale of 1920*1080. If it is a native resolution of display, so just making 
it full screen is enough. An IDE like PyCharm or any other should not overlap top 
 left quarter of the screen with an image, then the application will launch successfully.
